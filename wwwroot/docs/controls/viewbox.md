Title: Viewbox
---
The `Viewbox` is a decorator control which scales its child.
It can be used to **scale its child to fit** to the available space.

Though it can be used for any kind of control, it is often used to scale 2D images to a given space.

The `Viewbox` gives its child infinite space in the measure phase. It will constrain either or both sides when aranging it.
This depends on the Value of the `Stretch` property.

Here is an example of a button scaled up to fit the given space. Without the `Viewbox` the button would have
been rendered at around 22 dip height. With the `Viewbox` it will be displayed with a height of 300 dip:

```xml
<!-- button will occupy 22 dip under usual font sizes and dpi setting -->
<Button Content="Text"/>  

<!-- this button will be much larger -->
<Viewbox Stretch="Uniform" Height="300">
	<Button Content="Text"/>
</Viewbox>
```

# Common Properties

|Property|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|`Stretch`|One of the following values, determining the mode of scaling.|

## Values for `Stretch`
|Value        |Description|
|-------------|-----------|
|None         |The content preserves its original size.|
|Fill         |The content is resized to fill the destination dimensions. The aspect ratio is not preserved.|
|Uniform      |The content is resized to fit in the destination dimensions while preserving its native aspect ratio.|
|UniformToFill|The content is resized to completely fill the destination rectangle while preserving
               its native aspect ratio. A portion of the content may not be visible if the aspect
               ratio of the content does not match the aspect ratio of the allocated space.|
