We've backported several fixes from the `master` branch to our 0.8 codebase to be available as 0.8.1 on nuget:

- NumLock being disfuctional on Linux
- Blacklist for `llvmpipe` software OpenGL rasterizer on Linux (can be disabled in code or by setting `AVALONIA_GLX_IGNORE_RENDERER_BLACKLIST` environment variable to to `1`)
- Horrible jitter issue on Windows when OpenGL/ANGLE acceleration is enabled
- Black screen issue on Windows when OpenGL/ANGLE acceleration is enabled
