We are pleased to announce that [Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia) 0.10.0 has been
released.

0.10 is a huge update, it has been extensively tested and brings some great new features and improvements.

## Fluent Theme

The most noticable change for Avalonia 0.10 is a beautiful new Fluent theme. Now your Avalonia applications will look better than ever:

The fluent theme is available in light and dark modes, and will be used by the 0.10 templates by default. It can be enabled in existing applications by including the following in your `App.axaml`:

```
<Application.Styles>
  <FluentTheme Mode="Light"/>
</Application.Styles>
```

Where `Mode` can be `Light` or `Dark`.

## New Controls

Along with the fluent theme, several new controls have been added:

### DatePicker/TimePicker

The `DatePicker` and `TimePicker` controls give you a standardized way to let users pick a localized date or time value value using touch, mouse, or keyboard input.

```
<DatePicker Header="Date of birth"/>
```

### ToggleSwitch

`ToggleSwitch` is a control that can be toggled between 2 states.

```
<ToggleSwitch OffContent="Power Off" OnContent="Power On"/>
```

### Label

The `Label` control allows a text label with a shortcut key to be assocated with a control such as a `TextBox` such that pressing Alt plus the shortcut key will focus the associated control:

```xml
<StackPanel>
  <!-- Pressing Alt+N will focus nameTextBox -->
  <Label Target="nameTextBox">_Name</Label>
  <TextBox Name="nameTextBox">
</StackPanel>
```

The shortcut key is designated by prepending an underscore to the desired character in the `Label` content, `N` in this example.

## Compiled Bindings

Avalonia 0.10 includes experimental support for compiled bindings. When using compiled bindings, binding paths are verified at compile time and do not use reflection at runtime.

To enable compiled bindings, add an `x:DataType` attribute to your root control and use the `{CompiledBinding}` markup extension or set `x:CompileBindings="True"`.

```xml
<Window xmlns="https://github.com/avaloniaui"
        xmlns:x='http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml'
        x:Class="AvaloniaApplication"
        xmlns:vm="using:AvaloniaApplication.ViewModels" 
        x:DataType="vm:MainWindowViewModel">
  <!-- The existence of the MyValue property will be checked at compile-time -->
  <TextBox Text="{CompiledBinding MyValue}"/>
</Window>
```

## Unicode Support

Avalonia's `TextBlock` now correctly supports unicode characters.

Full Unicode support for `TextBox` will be incoming in the near future.

## Box Shadows

Box shadows can now be applied to `Border` controls:

```xml
<Border BoxShadow="4 4 4 gray"
        Background="Silver"
        Margin="20"
        Padding="10">
  <TextBlock>Box Shadow</TextBlock>
</Border>
```

The new features include:

- A built-in console using roslyn scripting which allows running arbitrary code
- Editing of property values
- Improved display and grouping of control properties
- Filtering control properties using a string or regular expression
- A visualization of a control's layout properties such as width, height, margins and padding:
- Toggle an FPS overlay and dirty rect visualization for the window from DevTools from the "Options" menu

## Typed Property Change Notifications

The `OnPropertyChanged` method and `AvaloniaProperty<T>.Changed` observable APIs have been changed to use a typed `AvaloniaPropertyChangedEventArgs<T>` class to prevent boxing. Note that this is a [breaking change](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia/wiki/Breaking-Changes).

## SelectionModel

Selection on `SelectingItemsControl`-derived controls such as `ListBox` and `ComboBox` now implement their selection tracking via a `SelectionModel` which gives the following improvements:

- Selection ranges are now stored as a range of indexes, so selecting all items in a large list of for example 100,000 elements is now stored simply as a range of `0-99999`. Previously each selected item was added to a list, inflating memory usage
- Selection now handles duplicate items
- The selection model can be bound to a view model allowing fine control of the selected items at the view model layer
