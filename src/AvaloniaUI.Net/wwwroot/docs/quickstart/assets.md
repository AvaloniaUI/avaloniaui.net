Title: Assets

Many applications need to include assets such as bitmaps and 
[resource dictionaries](/docs/styles/resources) in their executable and refer to these assets from 
XAML.

## Including assets

Assets can be included in an application by using the `<AvaloniaResource>` item in your project
file. The MVVM Application template by default includes all files in the `Assets` directory as an
`<AvaloniaResource>`:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <AvaloniaResource Include="Assets\**"/>
</ItemGroup>
```

You can include whatever files you want by adding additional `<AvaloniaResource>` elements.

:::note
You will notice that we're referring to _assets_ here whereas the MSBuild item is called an
Avalonia _resource_. Assets are internally stored as 
[.NET resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/managing-application-resources-dotnet)
but because the term "resource" conflicts with [XAML resources](/docs/styles/resources) we'll
refer to them as "assets" throughout.

## Referencing assets

Assets can be referenced in XAML by specifying their relative path:

```
<Image Source="icon.png"/>
<Image Source="images/icon.png"/>
<Image Source="../icon.png"/>
```

Or their rooted path:

```
<Image Source="/Assets/icon.png"/>
```

If the asset is located in a different assembly to the XAML file then use the `avares:`
URL scheme. For example if the asset is contained in an assembly called `MyAssembly.dll` then you
would use:

```
<Image Source="avares://MyAssembly/Assets/icon.png"/>
```

## Referencing manifest resources

Assets can also be included in .NET applications by using the `<EmbeddedResource>` MSBuild item
which causes the file to be included in the assembly as a 
[manifest resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.reflection.assembly.getmanifestresourcenames).

You can reference manifest resources using the `resm:` URL scheme:

```xml
<Image Source="resm:MyApp.Assets.icon.png"/>
```

Or if the resource is embedded in a different assembly to the XAML file:

```xml
<Image Source="resm:MyApp.Assets.icon.png?assembly=MyAssembly"/>
```

The name of the asset is automatically generated by MSBuild from the assembly name, the file path
and the filename - all separated with periods. If Avalonia is unable to find a manifest resource,
check the resource name using 
[`Assembly.GetManifestResourceNames`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.reflection.assembly.getmanifestresourcenames).

## Loading assets from code

Assets can be loaded from code using the `IAssetLoader` interface:

```csharp
var assets = AvaloniaLocator.Current.GetService<IAssetLoader>();
var bitmap = new Bitmap(assets.Open(new Uri(uri)));
```
