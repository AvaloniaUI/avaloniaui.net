There are two types of animations in Avalonia:

- [Keyframe animations](keyframe) animate any number of properties on a control, using any
number of keyframes to define the states that each property must pass through. Keyframe animations
are the more versatile type of animation.
- [Transitions](transitions) are used to animate a single property change.
