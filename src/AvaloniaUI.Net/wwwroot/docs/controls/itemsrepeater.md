Title: ItemsRepeater
---
A data-driven collection control that incorporates a flexible layout system, custom views, and virtualization.

`ItemsRepeater` is is a port of the UWP `ItemsRepeater` control. More documentation can be found

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.itemsrepeater?view=winui-2.3

The only difference between the two controls is that in Avalonia the `ItemsSource` is called `Items`.
